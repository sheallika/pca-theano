--------
pca-half

This divides the images into blocks of sizes (8, 8), (32; 32), (64, 64) and performs principal component analysis in each case. It visualizes reconstructions using different number of principal components and also visualizes the top components.

---------
pca-whole
This performs PCA on the whole images instead of blocs, using gradient descent.
